> In this project, we recreated a mini-verison of the ```printf``` function found in                                 
> the ```stdio.h``` library in the C programming language.
This function allows                                      
> us to print any argument given to the standard output or terminal and similar                                      
> printing functions can be found in any programming language. This means we can                                     
> print any combinations of strings, intergers, and other different data types.                                                                                                 
### Synopsis                                              
> This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom ```_printf```                                          
> function to run. This mini-version currently handles conversion specifiers:                                         
> ```c```, ```s```, ```%```, ```d```, ```i```, ```b```, ```o```
